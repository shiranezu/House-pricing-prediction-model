A simple machine learning project using scikit-learn, pandas, and Streamlit to predict house prices using the California Housing dataset.

This project demonstrates:

- Loading a built-in dataset

- Training regression models (Linear, Ridge, Lasso)

- Evaluating model performance

- Saving models with joblib

- A Streamlit web app for interactive prediction
